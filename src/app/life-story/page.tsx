        <p>üåç -18 ~ born, brought up in Ludhiana, Punjab ~ growing up, school, party, fun, yada yada ~ honestly I don't remember much & I think it's for the best, hehe.</p>
        <p>started my career journey at 19.</p>
        <p>went to Vancouver to study business, but 4 months in, i realised ~ i learn by doing, i finished my degree fast & jumped into the real world.</p>
        <p>since then, it‚Äôs been all hands-on experiments (fail-fast mentality) - some worked, most didn‚Äôt. each one taught me something meaningful, and brought more clarity to what I want to build.</p>
